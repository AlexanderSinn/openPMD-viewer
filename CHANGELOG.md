# Change Log / Release Log for openPMD-viewer

## 0.2.0

This is version `0.2.0` of openPMD-viewer. A number of minor changes and fixes have been made in order to make the package more general and to prepare it for a PyPI release. Here are the main changes:

- Support for the deprecated widget package `IPython.html` has been dropped. From now on, users need to install the widget package `ipywidgets`, for the GUI to work.
- The initialization of an `OpenPMDTimeSeries` object can now be made faster by setting the optional argument `check_all_files` to `False`.
- The data reader can now support `macroWeighted` quantities. As consequence, output files from [PIConGPU](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu) can now be correctly read.
- The package does not assume anymore that all species contain the same particle quantities. For instance, the package will support a file that contains the positions of ions, and the positions, momenta and weighting of electrons. As part of this, the attribute `OpenPMDTimeSeries.avail_ptcl_quantities` has been replaced by a dictionary `OpenPMDTimeSeries.avail_record_components`.
- This release introduces automatic PEP8 verification as part of the automatic tests that are run on Travis CI (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
